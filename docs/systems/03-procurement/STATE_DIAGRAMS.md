## üîÑ Cross-Workflow State Dependencies

### PR ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Receipt Flow

```
PR: DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí PO_CREATED
                 ‚Üì
PO: DRAFT ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí SENT ‚Üí PARTIAL_RECEIVED ‚Üí FULLY_RECEIVED ‚Üí COMPLETED
                                        ‚Üì
Receipt: DRAFT ‚Üí INSPECTING ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí POSTED
                                           ‚Üì
Inventory: quantity_on_hand updated
          drug_lots created
          inventory_transactions logged
```

### Budget Lifecycle Through Procurement

```
Budget: allocated_amount (Beginning of year)
            ‚Üì
PR submitted ‚Üí reserve_budget()
            ‚Üì
Budget: reserved_amount += PR.total
            ‚Üì
PR approved ‚Üí commit_budget()
            ‚Üì
Budget: reserved_amount -= PR.total
        spent_amount += PO.total
            ‚Üì
Budget: available = allocated - reserved - spent
```

## üìù Notes

### State Transition Rules

1. **No Backward Transitions**
   - States only move forward (except cancellation)
   - Cannot revert APPROVED ‚Üí DRAFT

2. **Atomic State Changes**
   - State changes happen in transactions
   - Includes all related updates (budget, inventory, etc.)

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All state changes logged with:
     - User ID
     - Timestamp
     - Reason (for REJECTED/CANCELLED)

4. **Side Effects**
   - State changes trigger database functions:
     - `reserve_budget()` on PR SUBMITTED
     - `commit_budget()` on PR APPROVED
     - `release_budget()` on PR CANCELLED/REJECTED
     - `update_inventory_from_receipt()` on Receipt POSTED

### Common Patterns

**Happy Path (PR ‚Üí PO ‚Üí Receipt):**
```
DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí PO_CREATED ‚Üí
PO:SENT ‚Üí FULLY_RECEIVED ‚Üí COMPLETED ‚Üí
Receipt:POSTED
```

**Cancellation Path:**
```
DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí CANCELLED ‚Üí BUDGET_RELEASED
```

**Rejection Path:**
```
DRAFT ‚Üí SUBMITTED ‚Üí REJECTED ‚Üí Archive
```
