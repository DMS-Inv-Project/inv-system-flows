# INVS Modern - Business Rules & Logic

## üè• System Overview

The INVS Modern system manages hospital inventory with integrated budget control and procurement workflow. This document outlines the core business rules and logic.

## üí∞ Budget Management Rules

### 1. Budget Allocation Structure
- **Fiscal Year**: January 1 - December 31
- **Quarterly Breakdown**: Q1-Q4 allocation required
- **Department-Based**: Each department has separate budget allocations
- **Type-Based**: Different budgets for drugs, equipment, supplies, etc.

### 2. Budget Control Logic
```
Total Budget = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4
Remaining Budget = Total Budget - Total Spent
Quarter Budget Available = Quarter Budget - Quarter Spent
```

### 3. Budget Validation Rules
- Purchase requests must not exceed available quarterly budget
- Budget reservations expire after 30 days if not converted to PO
- Budget transfers require approval from both departments
- Emergency budget can be used only with special authorization

### 4. Budget Status Types
- **ACTIVE**: Normal operation, purchases allowed
- **INACTIVE**: Budget suspended, no new purchases
- **LOCKED**: End of fiscal year, no modifications allowed

## üì¶ Inventory Management Rules

### 1. Stock Level Management
```
Reorder Point = (Daily Usage √ó Lead Time) + Safety Stock
Safety Stock = Minimum Level
Maximum Level = Reorder Point + Economic Order Quantity
```

### 2. FIFO/FEFO Rules
- **FIFO**: First In, First Out for non-expirable items
- **FEFO**: First Expire, First Out for drugs with expiry dates
- Expiring lots (< 30 days) must be used first
- Expired lots are automatically quarantined

### 3. Inventory Transaction Types
- **RECEIVE**: Goods received from purchase orders
- **ISSUE**: Dispensing to departments/patients
- **TRANSFER**: Movement between locations
- **ADJUST**: Stock corrections (count differences)
- **RETURN**: Returns from departments

### 4. Location Hierarchy
- **WAREHOUSE**: Central storage, bulk quantities
- **PHARMACY**: Patient dispensing, unit quantities
- **WARD**: Department-specific storage
- **EMERGENCY**: Critical care immediate access

## üõí Procurement Workflow

### 1. Purchase Request Process
```
Draft ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí Budget Check ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Convert to PO
```

### 2. Purchase Request Rules
- All requests must have department authorization
- Budget availability check before approval
- Items must reference valid drug generics
- Estimated costs required for budget planning

### 3. Purchase Order Process
```
Draft ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Sent ‚Üí Received ‚Üí Closed
```

### 4. Purchase Order Rules
- Must have valid vendor assignment
- Budget commitment occurs on approval
- Delivery dates must be realistic (vendor lead time)
- Partial receipts allowed with tracking

### 5. Goods Receipt Rules
- Must reference valid purchase order
- Quantities cannot exceed ordered amounts
- Lot numbers and expiry dates mandatory for drugs
- Quality checks before posting to inventory
